# Installing Omeka 2.5 in VirtualBox 5.1

This guide assumes :

* An installation of [VirtualBox 5.1](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).
* A [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/) or [Xubuntu](http://xubuntu.org/) desktop installation.

** Note : This installation procedure currently fails with "no connection" after proceeding to the omeka install.php. It does not seem to be a mod rewrite issue.**
